Here is my contribution, I'm not sure I understood clearly what you wanted but I did this, hope you'll like it. You can run the application using:

### `npm start`

It will run the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

Please don't forget to: 

### `npm install`

Also I added visibility filter thing at the end to show something using redux but I ended up forgetting to use it... Hope you'll still enjoy it.
